Django Urls - Basics to advanced tricks with best practices
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is where we map urls with python functions. Like the following
http://xyz.com/login -> login view
http://xyz.com/logout - logout view
http://xyz.com/list-items - some view to list items
http://xyz.com/item-detail/<item-slug> - some view to display item detasils

We can map urls using regular expression thus giuves us much more flexibility in serving web pages.
